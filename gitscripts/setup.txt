## Setup of sync scripts with Github ##

Installation and setup on Windows

- Install Git as told on http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/ and be sure to select the option displayed in "git_install_windows.PNG"
- Create the folder you want the project located in
- Open Git bash in the directory
- Run the following git command. This should download the system into the folder.
	git clone git://github.com/hnJaermuseet/JM-booking.git ./
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
- Make a shortcut to update_jmbooking.bat in the gitscripts folder
